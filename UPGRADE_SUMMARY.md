### Code Changes for Next.js 15 Compatibility

#### 1. Dynamic Route Params (Breaking Change)
In Next.js 15, route params are now async. Updated the following file:

**File**: `src/app/(main)/lessons/[day]/page.tsx`
- Changed param type from `{ params: { day: string } }` to `{ params: Promise<{ day: string }> }`
- Added `use()` hook to unwrap the params promise
- Added import for `use` from React

```typescript
// Before
const Page = ({ params }: { params: { day: string }; }) => {
  const day = params.day;
  // ...
}

// After
import { use } from "react";
const Page = ({ params }: { params: Promise<{ day: string }>; }) => {
  const { day } = use(params);
  // ...
}
```

#### 2. Cookies API (Breaking Change)
In Next.js 15, the `cookies()` function is now async. Updated the following files:

- `src/app/(auth)/auth/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/files/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/profile/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/register/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/social/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/social/lb/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(main)/social/spotted/actions.ts`
- `src/lib/api.ts`

Changed all instances of:
```typescript
// Before
cookies().get("token")
cookies().delete("token")

// After
(await cookies()).get("token")
(await cookies()).delete("token")
```

#### 3. TypeScript Configuration
Next.js automatically updated `tsconfig.json` during the upgrade:
- Set `target` to `"ES2017"` for top-level `await` support

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ Build completes successfully with no errors
✅ All routes compile correctly
✅ Static pages generate successfully

### Linting
✅ No ESLint warnings or errors
✅ TypeScript type checking passes

### Dependencies
✅ No npm deprecation warnings during installation
✅ No security vulnerabilities found

## Testing Recommendations

After deploying these changes, please verify:
1. **Authentication Flow**: Login/logout functionality works correctly
2. **Dynamic Routes**: Lesson pages load correctly with date parameters
3. **Server Actions**: All form submissions and data fetching work as expected
4. **Cookies**: Session management and authentication tokens are properly handled

## Docker Compatibility

The changes are fully compatible with the existing Docker setup:
- The `output: "standalone"` configuration is still supported in Next.js 15
- No changes needed to Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
- The upgrade will eliminate the deprecation warnings shown during Docker builds

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
npm install
npm run build
```

## Additional Notes

- React remains at version 18 (Next.js 15 supports both React 18 and 19)
- All existing functionality should continue to work as before
- The upgrade was focused on resolving deprecation warnings while maintaining backward compatibility
