# Login Redirect Loop Fix - January 30, 2025

## Issue Summary
Users were unable to log in to the application. After entering valid credentials and clicking "Accesso", they would be briefly redirected to `/app` but then immediately sent back to the login page at `/`, creating an infinite redirect loop.

## Root Cause
The `/api/auth/login` route was using `cookies().set()` from Next.js `next/headers`, which sets cookies in an internal store but **does not automatically attach them to the HTTP response**. When `NextResponse.json()` was returned, the Set-Cookie headers were missing, so the browser never received the authentication cookies.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Cookie Setting in API Route
**File:** `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

async function setAuthCookies(token: string, expire: string, tokenJwt: string) {
  const cookieStore = cookies();
  cookieStore.set("internal_token", tokenJwt, { ... });
  // ... more cookies
}

// In handler:
await setAuthCookies(token, expire, tokenJwt);
return NextResponse.json({ success: true }); // ❌ No cookies in response!
```

**After:**
```typescript
function setAuthCookiesOnResponse(
  response: NextResponse,
  token: string,
  expire: string,
  tokenJwt: string
) {
  const cookieOptions = {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.COOKIE_SECURE === 'true',
    sameSite: "lax" as const,
    path: "/",
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 2,
  };
  
  response.cookies.set("internal_token", tokenJwt, cookieOptions);
  response.cookies.set("tokenExpiry", new Date(expire).toISOString(), cookieOptions);
  response.cookies.set("token", token, cookieOptions);
  
  return response;
}

// In handler:
const response = NextResponse.json({ success: true });
setAuthCookiesOnResponse(response, token, expire, tokenJwt);
return response; // ✅ Set-Cookie headers included!
```

**Why this works:** Setting cookies directly on the `NextResponse` object ensures Set-Cookie headers are included in the HTTP response, allowing the browser to receive and store them.

### 2. Added Fetch Credentials Option
**File:** `src/app/(auth)/page.tsx`

```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/auth/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: "same-origin", // ✅ Ensure cookies are received
  body: JSON.stringify({ uid, pass }),
});
```

**Why this works:** The `credentials: "same-origin"` option tells the browser to process Set-Cookie headers from same-origin responses.

### 3. Added Delay Before Redirect
**File:** `src/app/(auth)/page.tsx`

```typescript
if (data.success) {
  console.log("[CLIENT] Login successful, redirecting to app");
  const redirectTo = goTo && ["/app", "/app/profile", "/app/register"].includes(goTo) 
    ? goTo 
    : "/app";
  
  // Small delay to ensure cookies are fully set in browser before redirect
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150));
  window.location.href = redirectTo;
}
```

**Why this works:** Browsers process Set-Cookie headers asynchronously. The 150ms delay ensures cookies are fully stored before navigation occurs, preventing race conditions.

### 4. Improved Error Handling
**File:** `src/app/(app)/app/page.tsx`

Added try-catch blocks around server action calls to prevent generic errors from causing unwanted redirects to the login page.

## Changes Summary

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` | Refactored cookie setting | Cookies now included in response |
| `src/app/(auth)/page.tsx` | Added credentials & delay | Ensures cookies are received and processed |
| `src/app/(app)/app/page.tsx` | Added error handling | Prevents false auth failures |

## Testing

All tests passed:
- ✅ `npm run build` - Build successful
- ✅ `npm run lint` - No errors or warnings
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Code review completed

## Deployment

After deploying this fix, users should:
1. Be able to log in successfully with valid credentials
2. Stay on the `/app` page without redirect loop
3. Remain authenticated across page navigation
4. See no "fetch failed" errors in server logs

## Technical Details

### Why cookies().set() Doesn't Work in API Routes

In Next.js API routes, `cookies()` returns a cookie store interface that maintains an internal state. Calling `cookies().set()` modifies this internal state but doesn't automatically propagate changes to the HTTP response being returned. The response needs explicit Set-Cookie headers.

### Why response.cookies.set() Works

`NextResponse` has its own `.cookies` property that directly modifies the response's headers. When you call `response.cookies.set()`, it adds the appropriate Set-Cookie header to that specific response object. When the response is returned to the client, these headers are included in the HTTP response.

### Cookie Options Explained

```typescript
{
  httpOnly: true,      // Cookie not accessible via JavaScript (security)
  secure: true,        // Cookie only sent over HTTPS (production)
  sameSite: "lax",     // CSRF protection, allows top-level navigation
  path: "/",           // Cookie available on all paths
  maxAge: 7200,        // Cookie expires after 2 hours
}
```

This fix resolves issues:

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:
```bash
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will revert the three commits that implement this fix.

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for any cookie-related issues in production
- Consider adding automated tests for authentication flow
- Document cookie handling patterns for future development
