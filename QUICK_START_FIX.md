# Quick Start Guide: Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

Your SysRegister application had two issues after login:
1. **RSC payload fetch errors** - Navigation links failed to load
2. **Cookie authentication failures** - Secure cookies didn't work over HTTP in Docker

Both issues are now fixed! âœ…

## What Changed

### 1. Navbar Navigation Fixed
All navigation links in the bottom navbar now have prefetching disabled, preventing RSC payload errors.

### 2. Cookie Security Made Flexible  
Authentication cookies now work correctly with both HTTP and HTTPS deployments:
- **Default (HTTP)**: Cookies work immediately
- **HTTPS setups**: Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` for secure cookies

## How to Deploy the Fix

### Quick Deploy (Default Setup)
```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

That's it! The app will now work correctly with HTTP.

### HTTPS Setup (Optional)
If you're using an HTTPS reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik):

1. Create or edit `.env` file:
```bash
COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## What to Expect

After deploying the fix:
- âœ… Login works smoothly
- âœ… No redirect loops
- âœ… No RSC payload errors
- âœ… Navigation works correctly
- âœ… All pages load properly
- âœ… Session authentication works

## Testing the Fix

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or your domain)
2. Login with your ClasseViva credentials
3. You should see the main dashboard
4. Click on navigation links (files, social, register, profile)
5. All pages should load without errors

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

**Clear browser cache and cookies:**
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
- Select "Cookies" and "Cached files"
- Clear data
- Try logging in again

**Check Docker logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f sysregister-app
```

Look for:
- `[loginAndRedirect] Token JWT generato e cookies impostati, successo` âœ… Good
- No "Failed to fetch RSC payload" errors âœ… Good
- No "failed to forward action response" errors âœ… Good (or if present, should be benign)

### If using HTTPS:

Make sure you set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in your environment, or cookies won't be sent by the browser.

## Files Changed

- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Disabled prefetch on navigation links
- `src/app/(auth)/auth/actions.ts` - Made cookie security configurable
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added COOKIE_SECURE environment variable
- `.env.example` - Added documentation for COOKIE_SECURE

- `REDIRECT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Previous redirect loop fix
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Database initialization fix

## Summary

This fix ensures that:
1. Navigation works reliably in Docker environments
2. Authentication cookies work with both HTTP and HTTPS
3. The application is more robust and user-friendly

The changes are minimal, focused, and thoroughly tested. ðŸŽ‰
